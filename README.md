# quiz-redeux

This project was to build a quiz that would display a start page then once the game had started a counter would start. As a user answers the questions the time continues to run down. If a user answers the question wrong five seconds is deducted from the rmaining time. At the conclusion of the quiz the users score is the remaining time left. 

The main two problems I ran into were A. with the local storage I was having trouble tryint to create an array and then pull the items from the array. The other issue was with the 5 secodn rule. I wrote code that would check the answer and the first couple of tried it worked but what i realized was that the further into the game you go the harsher the penalties were. Im very cutious how to fix this but Im stumped.
